        <span class="under"> My dream is to build a large house. </span> This house will have very big windows, so I can directly see <span class="through">the lush vitality of the trees.</span><br>
        I want to share joy with my family in a place that provides a sense of stability, <br>
        and based on that experience, <span class="over">I want to become a person who inspires others</span>.
